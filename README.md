# ProgrammersSurveyDataAnalysis
Data Analysis of Programmers Survey
This project analyzes a survey of programmers. The data was collected using Google Forms and contains information about the programmers' demographics, skills, and experience.

Libraries Used
The following libraries were used for this project:

1.Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
2.NumPy: For mathematical operations.
3.Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
4.Seaborn: For creating more advanced visualizations.

Data Exploration
The first step in the analysis was to explore the data. This involved looking at the data types, missing values, and distributions of the data.

Data Cleaning
After exploring the data, some cleaning was necessary. This involved removing missing values, correcting errors, and transforming the data into a format that was more suitable for analysis.

Data Analysis
The data was then analyzed to answer the following questions:

1.What are the demographics of programmers?
2.What are the most popular programming languages?
3.What are the most in-demand skills for programmers?
4.What are the salary expectations of programmers?

Sure, here's a more complete README for the project:
