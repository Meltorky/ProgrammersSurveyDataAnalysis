Data Analysis of Programmers Survey
This project analyzes a survey of programmers. The data was collected using Google Forms and contains information about the programmers' demographics, skills, and experience.

Libraries Used
The following libraries were used for this project:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For mathematical operations
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations
Seaborn: For creating more advanced visualizations
Power BI: For creating dashboards
Data Exploration
The first step in the analysis was to explore the data. This involved looking at the data types, missing values, and distributions of the data.

Data Cleaning
After exploring the data, some cleaning was necessary. This involved removing missing values, correcting errors, and transforming the data into a format that was more suitable for analysis.

Data Analysis
The data was then analyzed to answer the following questions:

What are the demographics of programmers?
What are the most popular programming languages?
What are the most in-demand skills for programmers?
What are the salary expectations of programmers?
Dashboard
A dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize the results of the analysis. The dashboard can be found at [link to dashboard].

Conclusion
This project analyzed a survey of programmers to gain insights into their demographics, skills, and experience. The results of the analysis can be used to help employers and programmers make better decisions.
